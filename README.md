# Bookie

[![CI](https://github.com/Nate1729/bookie/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Nate1729/bookie/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Bookie is a bookeeping command line tool. The idea behind this
came from me not wanting to use spreadsheets to have to handle all of my data.

# How to Run
Pull the repository down and run this command
```shell
poetry install
poetry run python bookie/main.py
```
